# Maximum subarray problem

The maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous
subarray within a one-dimensional array, `a[1...n]`, of numbers
which has the largest sum, where,

## Example

The list usually contains both positive and negative numbers along
with `0`. For example, for the array of
values `−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4` the contiguous subarray
with the largest sum is `4, −1, 2, 1`, with sum `6`.
